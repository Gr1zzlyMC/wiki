# 📦 Collections Guide

Collections track how much of each resource you have gathered across the server. They currently serve purely as a progress log and friendly competition tool—there are **no unlockable recipes, trades, or stat bonuses yet**. Building progress now simply keeps you ready for future features once rewards are introduced.

## 🔓 How Collections Work

* **Gather resources manually:** Mining, excavating, farming, ranching, foraging, fishing, and slaying hostile mobs all add toward their respective collections.
* **Check your totals:** Run `/collections` (or open the Collections menu, if available) to review progress and upcoming milestones.
* **Tiered milestones:** The interface still displays traditional tiers. Until rewards arrive, these tiers exist only for tracking purposes.
* **Future ready:** All progress you earn now will carry forward once rewards, recipes, and bonuses are introduced.

> 🎯 Collections are a long-term system. Even though unlocks are disabled right now, the progress you earn today will instantly count once rewards are enabled in a future update.

## 🛠️ Maximizing Collection Gains

1. **Group play sessions:** Collections only tick while someone is online and gathering, so organize grind sessions with friends.
2. **Keep tools upgraded:** Efficiency enchants and quality gear make manual gathering faster without automation.
3. **Streamline storage:** Empty your inventory beforehand so long farming sessions never hit a full inventory wall.
4. **Rotate activities:** Swap between farming, mining, and combat to refresh yourself while nudging multiple collections forward.
5. **Plan island layouts:** Design efficient crop fields, animal pens, and mining setups to maximize time spent gathering.

Collections may feel minimalist now, but the progress you earn today ensures you will be first in line when recipes, trades, and perks roll out. Stay diligent, compare stats with friends, and be ready to unlock everything the moment rewards go live!
