# 📦 Collections Guide

Collections track how much of each resource you have gathered across the server. Right now they serve purely as a progress log and friendly competition tool—there are **no unlockable recipes, trades, or stat bonuses yet**. Building progress now simply keeps you ready for future features once rewards are introduced.

## 🔓 How Collections Work

* **Gather resources:** Mining, excavating, farming, ranching, foraging, fishing, and combat grinding all add toward their respective collections.
* **Shared progress:** Your island members contribute to the same totals, so work together to push difficult tiers.
* **Check the menu:** Open the SkyBlock Menu (nether star) → **Collections**, or run `/collections` to view your totals and next milestones.
* **Tiered milestones:** Each collection still displays the traditional 9–12 tiers. Until rewards arrive, these tiers exist only for tracking purposes.

> 🎯 Reality check: Collections are a long-term system. Even though unlocks are disabled right now, the progress you earn today will instantly count once rewards are enabled in a future update.

## 🛠️ Maximizing Collection Gains

1. **Group play sessions:** Collections only tick while someone is online and gathering, so organize island grind nights.
2. **Upgrade your tools:** Efficient enchants, reforges, and potions keep manual gathering fast without automation.
3. **Carry a Sack:** Resource sacks auto-pickup bulk drops so nothing is wasted.
4. **Farm events:** Seasonal events like Spooky, Winter, or Mining Festivals often double specific collection gains.
5. **Island layout:** Design efficient crop fields, animal pens, and mining setups to grind manually when needed.

Collections may feel minimalist now, but the progress you earn today ensures you will be first in line when recipes, trades, and perks roll out. Stay diligent, compare stats with friends, and be ready to unlock everything the moment rewards go live!
