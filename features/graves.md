# 🪦 Graves – Never Lose Your Items Again

When you die on **Gr1zzlyMC**, your gear doesn’t scatter everywhere — instead, it’s stored safely in a **grave** so you can pick it back up without stress.

## ⚙️ How Graves Work

- Whenever you die, a **grave** appears at or near the location of your death.  
- All your **items and XP** are stored inside the grave.  
- **Only you** can open your grave and retrieve your belongings.  
- Graves last for a limited amount of time before they disappear — so try to recover them quickly.

## 🧰 Retrieving Your Items

1. Go to the location shown in chat.  
2. Find your grave — it looks like a gravestone.  
3. **Right-click** it to open and collect your items and XP.  
4. Once looted, the grave will vanish automatically.

## ⏳ Time Limits

- Graves remain in the world for a limited time.  
- If you don’t retrieve them before they expire, the items inside might be lost.  
- Logging out **does not pause** the timer, so plan your return as soon as you can.
