# ☠️ Death & Respawn

Death is part of the adventure on **Gr1zzlyMC** — but we’ve made sure it’s as stress-free as possible.  
Here’s everything you need to know about what happens when you die, how to get your items back, and where you’ll respawn.

## 🪦 Items Are Always Safe

When you die on Gr1zzlyMC:

- All your items and XP are stored safely inside a **[Grave](graves.md)**.  
- **Only you** can access your grave.  
- You **do not lose any coins** or currency when you die.  
- Your grave will remain for a limited time, giving you a fair chance to return and recover everything.

💡 **Tip:** Graves appear where you died (or on the nearest safe block if you fell into the void), and the coordinates are shown in chat.

## 🛏️ Respawn Locations

Where you respawn depends on where you were and whether you’ve set a bed:

### 🏝️ On Your Island
- If you **have a bed set**, you will respawn at that bed.
- If **no bed is set**, you will respawn at the **default spawn point on your island**.

### 🏙️ In the Hub
- If you die while in the **Hub**, you will respawn back at the **hub spawn**.

This ensures you’re never stranded far from home and can quickly return to your grave.

## 📍 Retrieving Your Items

Once you respawn:

1. Head back to that location.
2. **Right-click** your grave to collect all your items and XP.
3. Once you’ve looted it, the grave will disappear automatically.

⏳ If you don’t retrieve your grave before the time limit runs out, the items inside will be lost — so try to return quickly.
